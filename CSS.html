        <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript(JS)</span> is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
        While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. 
        <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
        imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about <span class="js">JavaScript</span>.
